Description: ===================================================================
        world -- Print mappings between country names and DNS country codes
        ===================================================================
        
        This script takes a list of Internet top-level domain names and prints out
        where in the world those domains originate from.  For example::
        
            $ world tz us
            tz originates from Tanzania, United Republic of
            us originates from United States of America (the)
        
        Reverse look ups are also supported::
        
            $ world -r united
            Matches for "united":
              ae: United Arab Emirates (the)
              gb: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)
              tz: Tanzania, United Republic of
              uk: United Kingdom (common practice)
              um: United States Minor Outlying Islands (the)
              us: United States of America (the)
        
        Only two-letter country codes are supported, since these are the only ones
        that were freely available from the ISO_ 3166_ standard.  However, as of
        2015-01-09, even these are no longer freely available in a machine readable
        format.
        
        This script also knows about non-geographic, generic, USA-centric, historical,
        common usage, and reserved top-level domains.
